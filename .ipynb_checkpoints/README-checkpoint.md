# Core message and hypothesis of our project

The goal of our project is to determine if any correlation can be found between Florida home values per county and the probability of a hurricane hitting that county.

Additionally we are hoping to determine which area has the least probability of getting hit by a hurricane and also correlate home values in that county.

# Questions & Data

We want to understand the true financial impact that hurricanes have on local economies.

Do hurricanes truly have an impact on home values?

Does an area with a higher probability of a hurricane or major hurricane hitting always have a higner median home value?

Is this due to additional construction costs involved in building a safe structure in these areas or are there other factors involved such as insurance costs etc.

We also want to estimate what is the expected financial loss per county in the event that a major hurricane hits there.

# Data Cleanup & Exploration

* To answer these questions we determined that we needed 4 basic groups of data:

Florida median home values per county

Latitude and longitude coordinates of each county

Historical storm data for hurricane landfalls

Historical data for major hurricane events

* Next we needed to figure out how to join the data in a useful way

Our goal was to analyze and visualize the data in a way that will make it easy for a viewer to determine the correlation if any between median home values and high hurricane probability.

This required cleaning, sorting, and organizing the data to allow for it to be joined.

After this, we created several visualizations detailing hurricane paths, probabilities, and correlation to median home values in Floria.


# Discussion

  * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

# Postmortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them.
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?
