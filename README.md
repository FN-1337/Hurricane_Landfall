# Core message and hypothesis of our project

The goal of our project is to determine if any correlation can be found between Florida home values per county and the probability of a hurricane hitting that county.

Additionally we are hoping to determine which area has the least probability of getting hit by a hurricane and also correlate home values in that county.

# Questions & Data

We want to understand the true financial impact that hurricanes have on local economies.

Do hurricanes truly have an impact on home values?

Does an area with a higher probability of a hurricane or major hurricane hitting always have a higner median home value?

Is this due to additional construction costs involved in building a safe structure in these areas or are there other factors involved such as insurance costs etc.

We also want to estimate what is the expected financial loss per county in the event that a major hurricane hits there.

# Data Cleanup & Exploration

* To answer these questions we determined that we needed 4 basic groups of data:

Florida median home values per county

Latitude and longitude coordinates of each county

Historical storm data for hurricane landfalls

Historical data for major hurricane events

* Next we needed to figure out how to join the data in a useful way

Our goal was to analyze and visualize the data in a way that will make it easy for a viewer to determine the correlation if any between median home values and high hurricane probability.

This required cleaning, sorting, and organizing the data to allow for it to be joined.

After this, we created several visualizations detailing hurricane paths, probabilities, and correlation to median home values in Floria.


# Discussion

 We found several interesting correlations in our data.
 
 First, we found that an increase in the probability of a hurricane making landfall does correlate with higher median home values.
 
 The best example in our data is Monroe County, which has the highest chance of a hurricane landfall and also has a signicantly higher median home value than the other counties in Florida.

# Postmortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them.
  
 Most of our real difficulties occured in the data mining and data cleaning phases of this project.
 
 First, we had to source the data for home prices in Florida per county which was simple enough.
 
 Then we had to come up with the data for Hurricane landfalls in Florida over the last several decades, which also wasn't very hard once we knew where to look.
 
 The most difficult part was combing through the data, determining what would benefit our analysis and what wouldn't, and then merging this data with the home value data.
 
 We sorted through lists, cleaned the data columns and formatting, and joined it with the real estate data in a way that would allow for us to show it in a meaningful visualization.
  
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?
  
  Are median home values correlated with flood insurance claims?
  
  Are median home values correlated with total loss claims?
  
  Which county has suffered the most property damage in the last 50 years?
  
  Does the county property damage history have a correlation with median home values?
